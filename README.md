## Welcome

If you'd like to know what is this place, you could visit [the main wiki page](https://github.com/DoronovIV/computer-science-learning/wiki) I created recently.

## Tl;dr

I created this one to store all the code and docs I produced while learning CS. From time to time I test some git features and exploring GitHub interface.
