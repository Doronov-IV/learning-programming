An archive for old and a workspace for new projects and exercises on my educational path.

[!] If someone happens to get here: I'm from Russia and sometimes I need to write
some code for Russian-speaking folks to look at. Although I often try to write in 
both langs to keep my brain fit.

	TL;DR:

My whole life was a battle for tiny bits of motivation due to my mental disorder.
It tried learning IT in a Russian university but to no luck.

It was 2021 that I've started a full-time "Software Development" course at our local
kind of private facility and I was surprised both by the community itself and
by the attitude towards its craftship.

I think, after a quarter of a century, I've finally found a bit of information about
my real place in this life. Anyway nvm .........


The roadmap is:

Console:

1) 'C++ procedural'
	– syntax and basic algorythms; (~ 6 months)

2) 'OOP via C++'
	– introduction to OOP, basic patterns; (~ 6 months)

3) 'Introduction to C#'
	– basic .NET concepts; (~ 3 months)

Visual:

4) 'Win Forms + WPF' as well as 'Ado Net + EFC'
	– an introduction to Visual interfaces; (~ 3 months)

5) 'Concurrency & Network programming'
	– brief basics; (~ 1 month)


At this point, both my groupmates and me, we all realised that most
of the useful things have passed. Our top teachers have also left.

Apart from this, our course should have gone through:

– Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS;

– Teamworking;

– ASP.NET: back & front;

– PHP (?);
