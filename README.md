## Welcome

If you would like to know what is this place, you could visit [the main wiki page](https://github.com/DoronovIV/computer-science-learning/wiki) I created recently.

## Tl;dr

I have created this one to store all the code and docs I produced while learning Computer Science (mainly programming). From time to time I test some git features and exploring GitHub interface.
I am aware that there is a lot of so called 'dead' code no one will ever be interested into. However I would like to keep it just for myself. I live the most boring life and I do not usually take any photos. Therefore this repository is rather a museum-like than some kind of a set of working tools. The code contains lots of my memories, all of it.
