# My computer science learning

An archive for old and a workspace for new projects and exercises on my educational path.

## Disclaimer

If someone happens to get here: I'm from Russia and sometimes I need to write
some code for Russian-speaking folks to look at. Although I often try to write in 
both langs to keep my brain fit.

## Short reminder for myself

My whole life was a battle for tiny bits of motivation due to my mental disorder.
It tried learning IT at a Russian university but to no luck.

It was 2021 that I've started a full-time "Software Development" course at our local kind of private facility and I was surprised both by the community itself and by the attitude towards its craftship.

And I think, after a quarter of a century, I've finally found a bit of information about my real place in this life. At this point, I've already understood that you can literally teach monkey to program for you and it's just a mater of will.

# Roadmap

## Console

### C++ procedural (~ 6 months)
 Syntax and basic algorythms. Loops, sortings, files, structures, etc.

### OOP via C++ (~ 3 months)
 Introduction to OOP, basic principles. The Gang of Four patterns.

### Introduction to .NET and C# (~ 3 months)
 Basic .NET concepts. New syntax and mechanisms.

## Visual

### Ado Net + EFC  via  Win Forms + WPF (~ 3 months)
 An introduction to Visual interfaces. Brief former ADO NET api.
 Then, switch to the wpf and an introduction to EFC.

### Concurrency & Network programming (~ 1 month)
 Threads, tasks and synchronization basics. Then, switch to networks: sockets and clients.

## Intellectika

### Delegation (~ 1 week)
Basic syntax via practice on a custom 'Paint'-like application using GDI+. Implementing graphics action with lambda-expressions, dealling with closure. Actions stacking dispatch for managing delegate data in collections.

### Concurrency (actual)
Basic api, working on a custom application that calculates PI number via Monte Carlo technique.
