# My computer science learning

An archive for old and a workspace for new projects and exercises on my educational path.

## Disclaimer

If someone happens to get here: I'm from Russia and sometimes I need to write
some code for Russian-speaking folks to look at. Although I often try to write in 
both langs to keep my brain fit.

## Short reminder for myself

My whole life was a battle for tiny bits of motivation due to my mental disorder.
It tried learning IT at a Russian university but to no luck.

It was 2021 that I've started a full-time "Software Development" course at our local kind of private facility and I was surprised both by the community itself and by the attitude towards its craftship.

And I think, after a quarter of a century, I've finally found a bit of information about my real place in this life. At this point, I've already understood that you can literally teach monkey to program for you and it's just a mater of will.

# Roadmap

## Console

### C++ procedural (~ 6 months)
 Syntax and basic algorythms. Loops, sortings, files, structures, etc.

 An introduction to Visual interfaces. Brief former ADO NET api.
 Then, switch to the wpf and an introduction to EFC.

## Change of plans

 At this point, both my groupmates and me, we all realised that most of the useful topics have passed. Our top teachers have also left.
 During our main teacher departure, he's made some of us an offer which neither of us would deny. And at a time I'm writing those lines, I've alredady 
 quit ITStep due to the new studying at one of our local office.

## The topics left in our former course

– Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS;

– Teamworking and Team Project Management;

– ASP.NET: back & front;

– Java from scratch. (?)
