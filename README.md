# My computer science learning

An archive for old and a workspace for new projects and exercises on my educational path.

## Disclaimer

If someone happens to get here: I'm from Russia and sometimes I need to write
some code for Russian-speaking folks to look at. Although I often try to write in 
both langs to keep my brain fit.

## Short reminder for myself

My whole life was a battle for tiny bits of motivation due to my mental disorder.
It tried learning IT at a Russian university but to no luck.

It was 2021 that I've started a full-time "Software Development" course at our local kind of private facility and I was surprised both by the community itself and by the attitude towards its craftship.

And I think, after a quarter of a century, I've finally found a bit of information about my real place in this life. At this point, I've already understood that you can literally teach monkey to program for you and it's just a mater of will.
