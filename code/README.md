# Code
This node is actually a warehouse of (almost) all the tasks and excercises I was assigned either by myself or with help of my teachers.

# Roadmap
I actually started learning programming acidently when my family told me about those private courses fresh opened in our city.
It was a Ukrainian international kind of company, pretty cheap and niche, if you would like to compare.
It's been a year and a half and I still don't know why I started it. But I liked studying there at first.

We were introduced to Cisco EITE almost-free-course, which we successfully passed in half a year. (It's a garbage course by itself, but by the time we started it, I was the only person in a group who lacked hardware knowledge)
In parallel, we began to learn C++ basics using procedural console projects. It was a mess, since we started to learn git only half a year later. (I sort of liked it nonetheless)
After half a year a new teacher was introduced to us. It took us an anfair amount of time to fully understand how cool he actually was at that time.
With this guy we spent somewhat 9 months learning OOP and design patterns, firstly using C++, then switching to C# (.NET 6 standard).
(I think I would like to take a pause here for now).

## C++ ITstep

### Procedural
Ivan Reshetov's course.

### OOP 
Andrei Sobol's one.

## C# ITstep

### Basics
Common concepts of .NET via console kind of applications.

### Visual
An Introduction to visual interface programming, in parallel with introduction to databases.
This section if split between "windows forms" and "wpf" nodes respectively in order.

### Surov
After our only true teacher decided to abundon our courses due to his tight schedule (as well as host company rapid failing), we were introduced to another kind of person which I have little desire to discuss.
Let's just say our group was at the edge of collapse for some time.

## WEB

Work in progress.
