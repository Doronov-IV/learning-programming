*Abramyan is a professor at our local university who is a member of a team that created
Pascal ABC.NET. It's a pretty cool thing to educate young students who cannot yet
quickly understand concepts of pointers and other lower-level things.

(Also, in Russia Pascal language is highly popular at universities and factory, for some reason)
