# 'ITStep' (renamed to 'Top') courses
You are in a "ITStep courses" node.
Issue: 

This node was kept as a depository for some private courses activities I used to attend.
The sub-nodes are pretty self-explanatory so I would not bother documenting them. 

## Sub nodes

### Node 'Andrei Sobol'
Contains homeworks for about half a year period, including learning syntax via console applications, introduction to Windows Forms and WPF. The last one was used to work on ADO.NET and EFC technologies.
This time was pretty pleasant and cosy, Andrei's teaching manner was sometimes unsure and overextensive but this came with a lot of productivity and most of useful information. And his programming coding style was not just high, but somewhat inspiring which resulted in lots of motivation for me.

### Node 'Alexander Surov'
Is almost empty. This segment was short and undesirable. The homeworks, unlike Andrei's, were not manualy designed, but kept stock from ITStep courses which are really boring and unproductive. Besides this, Alexander's teaching style was ... somewhat chaotic and muddled, so nobody really wanted to spend time on it.
