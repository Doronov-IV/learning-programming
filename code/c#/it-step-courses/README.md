# "ITStep"/"Top" courses
You are in a "ITStep courses" node.
Issue: 

This node was kept as a depository for some private courses activities I used to attend.
The sub-nodes are pretty self-explanatory so I would not bother documenting them. 

## Sub nodes

### Node "Exams"
Contains my exam projects our teachers would assign to us to make sure we got some topics.
Currently, it contains only our latest teacher assignmets since Andrei Sobol had different kind of convention, when students should provide some specific array of homeworks (which were pretty tough).

### Node "Homework"
It's just a place where I could complete homeworks assigned by my teachers.
The "Alexander Surov" node is currently empty since his classes were a painful experience for me, and I had already started intellectika courses by that time.
The "Andrei Sobol" node on the other side has a complete colletion of workload for he is my teacher in both ITStep and intellectika.
