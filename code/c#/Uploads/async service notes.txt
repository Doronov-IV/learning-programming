	Intro

Handshake system  may be viable.

Task completion source for asynchronous connection can solve the "Netlock" problem.


	Initial part
	
Two parts: client and server. Client knows server endpoint. But the server does not know the client's one.

Therefore: two applications respectively. With help of a third assembley (most likely to be a library) to include common logic. 

Using C# reflection we can send to the server the name of method of the server.

The status of the request is implemented via enum.
