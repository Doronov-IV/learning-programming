This exam wasn't a serious project. It's been imposed by our courses program and neither my
mates nor me chose this particular task.

The objective is: 

â€“ To create a programm that could search all text files of the PC for the
 list of some 'rude' words. Fild those files, copy and censore copies. 
You also should make a valid progress bar (so you'll have to run twice). 
It should be done as fast as possible, so since it's called a concurrency exam, 
we've had to use multitasking.

Since our current teacher is a neanderthal, he gives 0 concern about UI and code quality.
