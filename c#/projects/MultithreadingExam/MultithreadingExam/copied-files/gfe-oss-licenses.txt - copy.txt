      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work ******* for which the

      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms ******* conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithst*******ing the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      ******* charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations *******/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf ******* on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, ******* only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, ******* hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

OpenSSL is covered by one of two licenses, depending on which release is involved. In all cases, there is a file named LICENSE in the top-level of the release. Copies can also be found here.
For the 3.0 release, ******* later releases derived from that, the Apache License v2 applies. This also applies to the git "master" branch.
For any release made before OpenSSL 3.0 (namely the 1.1.1, 1.1.0, 1.0.2, ******* all prior releases including those not currently supported), the dual OpenSSL ******* SSLeay license applies. Note that this is also true for any updates to those releases -- the "letter suffix" -- no matter when they are made. It also applies to the git branches for all those releases, ******* to any public forks that have not rebased to master (or 3.0).

Author: kenton@google.com (Kenton Varda)
 Based on original Protocol Buffers design by
 Sanjay Ghemawat, Jeff Dean, ******* others.

This file contains classes which describe a type of protocol message.
You can use a message's descriptor to learn at runtime what fields
it contains ******* what the types of those fields are.  The Message
interface also allows you to dynamically access ******* modify individual
fields by passing the FieldDescriptor of the field you are interested
in.

Most users will not care about descriptors, because they will write
code specific to certain protocol types ******* will simply use the classes
generated by the protocol compiler directly.  Advanced users who want
to operate on arbitrary types (not known at compile time) may want to
read descriptors in order to learn about the contents of a message.
A very small number of users will want to construct their own
Descriptors, either because they are implementing Message manually or
because they are writing something like the protocol compiler.

For an example of how you might use descriptors, see the code example
at the top of message.h.
