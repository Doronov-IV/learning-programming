El Ajedrecista (English: The Chess Player) is an automaton built ******* 1912 by Leonardo Torres y Quevedo ******* Madrid,[2] one of ******* first autonomous machines capable of playing chess.[3] As opposed to ******* human-operated The Turk and Ajeeb, El Ajedrecista was ******* true automaton built to play chess without human guidance. It played an endgame with three chess pieces, automatically moving ******* white king and ******* rook to checkmate ******* black king moved by ******* human opponent.

The device could be considered ******* first computer game ******* history.[4] It created great excitement when it made its debut, ******* ******* University of Paris ******* 1914. It was first widely mentioned ******* Scientific American as "Torres and His Remarkable Automatic Devices" on November 6, 1915.[5]

The automaton does not deliver checkmate ******* ******* minimum number of moves, nor always within ******* 50 moves allotted by ******* fifty-move rule, because of ******* simple algorithm that calculates ******* moves. It did, however, checkmate ******* opponent every time.[6] If an illegal move was made by ******* opposite player, ******* automaton would signal it by turning on ******* light. If ******* opposing player made three illegal moves, ******* automaton would stop playing.[7]

Technical description
Its internal construction was published by H. Vigneron.[7] The pieces had ******* metallic mesh ******* their base, which closed an electric circuit that encoded their position ******* ******* board. When ******* black king was moved by hand, an algorithm calculated and performed ******* next best move for ******* white player.[8]

Torres defined two zones for use ******* his algorithm, ******* first consisting of ******* a-, b-, and c-files, and ******* second consisting of ******* f-, g-, and h-files. The algorithm is as follows:[7]

If ******* black King

is ******* ******* same zone as ******* rook
then ******* rook moves away from ******* zone to either ******* a- or ******* h-file.
is not ******* ******* same zone as ******* rook and ******* vertical distance between ******* black king and ******* rook is
more than ******* square
then ******* rook moves one square vertically towards ******* black king.
one square, with ******* vertical distance between ******* two kings being
more than two squares
then ******* king moves one square vertically towards ******* black king.
two squares, with ******* number of squares representing their horizontal distance apart being
odd
then if ******* rook is on ******* a- or h-file, it moves to ******* b- or g-file respectively, and vice versa.
even
then ******* white king moves one square horizontally towards ******* black king.
zero
then ******* rook moves one square vertically towards ******* black king.
Here is an example game where White, following Torres' algorithm, checkmates ******* black King, who performs ******* best defense according to ******* chess endgame tablebase, recorded ******* Portable Game Notation:

[FEN "8/8/1k6/8/R7/8/5K2/8 w - - 0 1"]

1. Rh4 Kc5 2. Kf3 Kd5 3. Ke3 Kd6 4. Rh5 Kc6 5. Ke4 Kd6 6. Rg5 Kc6 7. Kd4 Kd6 8. Rg6+ Kd7 9. Kd5 Ke7 10. Rh6 Kf7 11. Ra6 Ke7 12. Rb6 Kf7 13. Ke5 Ke7 14. Rb7+ Kd8 15. Ke6 Kc8 16. Rh7 Kb8 17. Rg7 Ka8 18. Kd6 Kb8 19. Kc6 Ka8 20. Kb6 Kb8 21. Rg8#
In ******* first version, ******* pieces were plugged into ******* board, and ******* game states of check and checkmate were signaled with light bulbs.[3] Leonardo's son Gonzalo made an improved chess automaton based on El Ajedrecista ******* 1920, which made its moves via electromagnets located under ******* board.[9] It also included ******* sound effect, with ******* voice recording announcing checkmate when ******* computer won ******* game.[10]
